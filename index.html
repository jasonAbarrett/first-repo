          <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Arte del Mundo&reg; is a non-profit service that allows individual local
              artists and crafts persons around the world to be able to market their
              products directly to a global audience. These fine products are
              handcrafted and are of the highest quality. You avoid the high markup
              cost of retail stores when you purchase directly from the artist that
                produces the goods. Note that this website is informational only.
                All sales are made directly via the artists themselves. We’re here
                to facilitate and inform.</p>

                <p>Arte del Mundo people are in two general categories. First and foremost 
                  are the artists themselves, known as Member Artists. Secondly, there is a 
                  large group of important people, people who like 
                  to help Arte del Mundo grow and prosper. These are officially
                  Friends of Arte del Mundo (more about Friends
                <a href="friendsInfo.html"> here</a>.) Please consider becoming a Friend.

          <h4>Inside Arte del Mundo</h4>
            <p>If you are already a Member Artist,
              and would like
            to begin selling an additional category of products, please fill out a
            New Product Form, and submit it to be processed. Note that it may take
            several weeks to process, since it does involve modifications to some of
            the web pages.</p>
